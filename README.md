# Cursed Warzone
A campaign mod for Warzone 2100 that completely ruins the story and adds a whole bunch of stupid funny stuff.<br>
**WARNING**: FLASHING LIGHTS AND LOUD(er) SOUNDS

------------------
Spoiler Warning!!!
------------------
It is HIGHLY recommended that you play through the mod's campaign fully at least once before going through the mod's files, or else you might tarnish part of the experience for yourself (This README is spoiler free though!). But if you've already beaten the mod, then feel free to look around!

------------
Installation
------------
After downloading the cursed.wz file, place it into your `mods/campaign` folder in your main warzone directory (If you can't find the main directory, click "Open Configuration Directory" in the Options menu). After moving cursed.wz into the campaign folder, launch the game. You should now see a "Cursed Warzone" campaign in the campaign selector.

--------------------
Playing With The Mod
--------------------
To get started, simply click Single Player -> New Campaign and then pick one of the three campaigns. It is highly recommended to start with the first of the three campaigns (or else everything will make even less sense).<br>
This mod DOES NOT support Skirmish/Multiplayer games! Please disable the mod before trying to play those or else your computer will be banished to the void or something.

With that out of the way, I hope you will enjoy / have enjoyed Cursed Warzone!
